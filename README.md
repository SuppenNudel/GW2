# GW2
Download the GW2 Tools_[version].jar file.

You can just execute it. The application will store a bunch of files on your local drive under C:\Users\\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\GW2 Tools.

The combined file size can go up to 50MB. If you don't want the files to get stored don't use the app and wait for a version where you have the option to let the application get the data everytime you have a request. (But don't hold your breath for it) ^^

Before you can use it you have to enter your GW2 API Key by opening Edit -> Settings.

There you are also able to set your prefered Language.


Currently English and German are supported for the app and English, German, Spanish French and Chinese for the game assets.

When you entered your API Key all recipies are getting loaded.

Then you can select a character you wish to level your crafting with.

You have a few options to filter out a bunch of recipies.

1) you find your desired recipe faster
2) the application has fewer stuff to handle; thx :D
